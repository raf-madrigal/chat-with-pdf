The coastal areas have a temperate climate with mild and rainy winters, while inland regions have harsh winters with daily average temperatures near -15°C  , which can drop below -40°C   with severe wind chills. Snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year in non-coastal regions, and in parts of the north, snow can persist year-round. Canada is also geologically active, with many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes.\n",

      "QUESTION # 2: Describe Canada's Government\n",
      "Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy. The monarchy of Canada is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, to carry out most federal royal duties in Canada on their advice. The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada, but the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations. The use of executive powers is otherwise directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and headed by the prime minister. The governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Commons. Canada is described as a \"full democracy\" with an emphasis on social justice and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology. At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties: the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right Conservative Party of Canada.\n",
