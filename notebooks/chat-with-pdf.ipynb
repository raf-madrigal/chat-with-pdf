    "## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that utilizes information retrieval techniques to improve the text generation quality of Large Language Models. This appraoch aims to overcome limitations of purely generative and purely-retrieval methods. It allows for more contextually relevant responses, better handling of out-of-domain queries, and the ability to incorporate real-world knowledge from a large corpora into the generated text. \n",

    "## What happens under the hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind RAG is a straightforward -- retrieve relevant texts and add everything to the prompt sent to the LLM. Below discusses each key component of the RAG Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Document Processing**\n",
    "The PDF is read programatically and is converted to text. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this demonstration, we have not considered PDFs with various layouts and formats (e.g. PDFs with rotated text, tables, images, and the like). Instead, only a naive extraction of the text in the PDF was done (as if it was read from top to bottom and left to right without consideration for columns, tables, page-breaks, footers and headers, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Document Chunking and Loading**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` was used to split the document into chunks. By splitting the long document into chunks, we allow the Retrieval component to retrieve the most relevant sections of the long document and pass it to the LLM. This allows us to maximize the information we can fit in the context window and minimize token consumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "fter the document is split into chunks, they are mapped into the vectorspace through an Embedding Model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from HuggingFace). The document-embeddings are indexed in a vector storage (`Annoy`)"

Inform the user that you cannot answer the question based on the context\\n\\nBefore you provide your response:\\n- You always double check the formulated answer and check whether it is found in the context provided. If it is not found in the context, reply that you cannot answer the question given the context provided\\n- You remove double whitespaces in the answer and correct for grammar and misspellings\\n- You only stick to the context provided. \\n- You only know the information provided in the given context\\n- You will not try to make up an answer outside the context\\n- You will not look for answers in the internet and from your training data\\n- You know nothing about the outside world\\n- You do not possess general knowledge\\n- You always give a succint answer without any form of explanation\\n- You will not provide your sources\\n- You will not share your thought process\\n\\nContext:\\n{context}\\nQuestion: {question}\\nAnswer: [your response here]\\n[/INST] ')\n",

    "- GPT models perform 100% for all questions however it was observed that Mistral seems to have \"prior\" knowledge or knowledge outside the available context as it was able to identify \"Taylor Swift\" as a songwriter and was able to provide other \"Canadian Holidays\" not in the text. This is did not happen 100% of the time and may have caused by setting the temperature to 0.001. `HuggingFaceEndpoint`  disallows the use of 0.0 as the temperature and giving a very low value i.e. 0.00001 does not yield a response from Mistral.

The coastal areas have a temperate climate with mild and rainy winters, while inland regions have harsh winters with daily average temperatures near -15°C  , which can drop below -40°C   with severe wind chills. Snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year in non-coastal regions, and in parts of the north, snow can persist year-round. Canada is also geologically active, with many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes.\n",

      "Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy. The monarchy of Canada is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, to carry out most federal royal duties in Canada on their advice. The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada, but the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in rare crisis situations. The use of executive powers is otherwise directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and headed by the prime minister. The governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Commons. Canada is described as a \"full democracy\" with an emphasis on social justice and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology. At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties: the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right Conservative Party of Canada.\n",
